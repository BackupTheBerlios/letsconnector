letsconnector-0007 alisdair, sekenre 29/08/2004

Added instructions on committing to the diary.


letsconnector-0006 alisdair, sekenre 29/08/2004

M changelog.txt
M diary.txt

Now use berlios.org usernames for logging commits and diary entries.

M cgi-bin/Fields.py

Numerous renamings. Commented out DateField -- it's useless for the time
being. Added IntField class. Eliminated Field superclass.

M cgi-bin/LetsForms.py
M misc/tables.sql

Removed personal information fields from CreateMember class.

A doc/lets_letter.tex

Project announcement letter for UK LETS groups.


letsconnector-0005 sekenre 10/08/2004

Added us to Trove and put in a short description. Details in diary.txt


letsconnector-0004 alisdair 09/08/2004

M Fields.py
M Form.py
M LetsForms.py

Added db_action() function to the Form type, which performs the action
associated with that form. Implemented for CreateMember.

M create_member.cgi

Changes so that the above actually happens. At the moment the output on
completing the action (which will be seen in the browser) is just a list
of the relevant fields. Ideally 

A lets_db.py

New utility module, with one function (used by Form to connect to the
database).

A lets_form.py

New utility module which isn't used yet.

M lets_html.py

Some helpers moved to the Form class where they really belong.


letsconnector-0003 alisdair 11/07/2004

Summary:
- Some class-based stuff, as proposed in previous musings (see
  new diary.txt with same date for explanation)

A diary.txt

Added new diary, first entry is cut-and-paste of an email to Kio.

A cgi-bin/Fields.py
M cgi-bin/lets_html.py

These represent fields in a form. At present they have grabbed the HTML
generation stuff which was in lets_html.py

A cgi-bin/Form.py

The Form classes will represent whole forms.

A cgi-bin/LetsForms.py
M cgi-bin/create_member.cgi

At present there's only one for CreateMember, which takes the data which was
previously in create_member.cgi. I think this is a lot more elegant, and will
save repetition.


letsconnector-0002 alisdair 22/06/2004

The create_member.cgi script and lets_html.py now work (have run these on my
own machine). After the submit create_member.cgi simply prints the input it
was given, the next step is to get it to connect to the database. I'm still
pondering the use of some kind of CGI framework, looking at:
http://crawdad.sourceforge.net/doc/2.0/index.html
http://thraxil.org/code/cgi_app/
http://www.object-craft.com.au/projects/albatross/albatross/


letsconnector-0001 alisdair 22/06/2004

Added the cgi-bin directory, this changelog, and the (small and incomplete)
Python files left out of the initial import.
