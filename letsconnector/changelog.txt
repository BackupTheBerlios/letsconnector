--- Please post new entries at the top of the changelog

letsconnector-0003 AWT 11/07/2004

Summary:
- Some class-based stuff, as proposed in previous musings (see
  new diary.txt with same date for explanation)

A diary.txt

Added new diary, first entry is cut-and-paste of an email to Kio.

A cgi-bin/Fields.py
M cgi-bin/lets_html.py

These represent fields in a form. At present they have grabbed the HTML
generation stuff which was in lets_html.py

A cgi-bin/Form.py

The Form classes will represent whole forms.

A cgi-bin/LetsForms.py
M cgi-bin/create_member.cgi

At present there's only one for CreateMember, which takes the data which was
previously in create_member.cgi. I think this is a lot more elegant, and will
save repetition.


letsconnector-0002 AWT 22/06/2004

The create_member.cgi script and lets_html.py now work (have run these on my
own machine). After the submit create_member.cgi simply prints the input it
was given, the next step is to get it to connect to the database. I'm still
pondering the use of some kind of CGI framework, looking at:

letsconnector-0001 AWT 22/06/2004

Added the cgi-bin directory, this changelog, and the (small and incomplete)
Python files left out of the initial import.
