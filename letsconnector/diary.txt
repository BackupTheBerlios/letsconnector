From an email to Kio:

"Having looked at a few CGI frameworks .... I'm inclined to agree with you -- 
what do we need those for? Might nick a few ideas from them though, or even a 
few functions if they're GPL'd.

A lot of them are heavily template based, which I think is the wrong way to 
go. It seems to me that programs should be honest about what they're doing -- 
if they're generating HTML, then that's what the code should say. (Albatross, 
which I'd thought looked to be the furthest forward, even added extra tags to 
its templates, with conditionals and loops!) Hence the approach in my 
create_member.cgi, using helper functions to keep the HTML generation clear. 
I hope to do the same for the processing of the form input.

I considered some kind of class-based structure, with classes such as Form, 
Session etc. This would seem to be dishonest, as it implies statefulness 
which we don't have -- every time a http request generates a CGI call, we get 
a new instance of the interpreter. (It follows from this that such classes 
are inefficient)."
